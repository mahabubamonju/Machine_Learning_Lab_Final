# Machine Learning & Data Mining Lab
In this sentiment analysis project, we gathered and manually categorized a sizable dataset from twitter and Facebook comments. This dataset I collected from Kaggle and pre-process by own way. This dataset includes thoughts from viewers about various English comments and postings. As we are interested in Social media sentiment data we collected data based on negative, positive and another is neutral. In this project I included several enhancement methods, including feature extraction, classification algorithms, NLP techniques, and more, including the ability to recognize polarity. This paper evaluates a sentiment analysis study that was conducted on 999 Facebook posts and 162980 tweets, which were then combined and further processed. Here, I apply the ML algorithms SVM, DT, XGBoost, and deep learning-based algorithm LSTM.
